# Kunai CellSprite Editor
Kunai is a tool to edit Ninja CSD Project files (XNCP,YNCP,GNCP,SNCP) from Sonic the Hedgehog games from Shadow the Hedgehog to Sonic Colors Ultimate.

## Why "Kunai"?
The project is called Kunai because it is heavily based on [Shuriken](https://github.com/crash5band/Shuriken), another editor for CSD files.

## File Support
Kunai can currently read these file formats:
- xncp (Sonic the Hedgehog (2006), Sonic Generations)
- Split xncp (Sonic Colors Ultimate)
- yncp (Sonic Unleashed)
- gncp (Shadow the Hedgehog (GameCube), Sonic and the Secret Rings, Sonic and the Black Knight)
- Split gncp (Sonic Colors)
- sncp (Shadow the Hedgehog (PS2))
 > [!NOTE]  
> The program cannot write these files as **split gncp** and **sncp** files yet, so they can only be saved as other formats.
