# Kunai CellSprite Editor
Kunai is a tool to edit Ninja CSD Project files (XNCP,YNCP,GNCP,SNCP) from Sonic the Hedgehog games from Shadow the Hedgehog to Sonic Colors Ultimate.
To learn more about the process of editing these files, check the HedgeDocs guide page [here.](https://wiki.hedgedocs.com/index.php/How_to_use_Kunai)

## Why "Kunai"?
The project is called Kunai because it is heavily based on [Shuriken](https://github.com/crash5band/Shuriken), another editor for CSD files.

## File Support
 > [!NOTE]  
> The program cannot write any of these files as **split gncp** and **sncp** files yet, so they can only be saved as other formats.
Kunai can currently read these file formats:
- xncp (Sonic the Hedgehog (2006), Sonic Generations)
- Split xncp (Sonic Colors Ultimate)
- yncp (Sonic Unleashed)
- gncp (Shadow the Hedgehog (GameCube), Sonic and the Secret Rings, Sonic and the Black Knight)
- Split gncp (Sonic Colors)
- sncp (Shadow the Hedgehog (PS2))

## Features
### QOL Improvements
Compared to Shuriken, Kunai has a different user interface, based off of [HexaEngine's ImGui.NET](https://github.com/HexaEngine/Hexa.NET.ImGui), with a lot of extra colors and icons to easily distinguish different things! 

You can also click directly into the viewport to select Casts, and you can edit animations by dragging the keyframe once an animation is selected by clicking on the scene.
